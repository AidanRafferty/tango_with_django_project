<!-- informs django that we will be using static files within the template.
 This allows us to access the media in the static directories via the use
 of the static template tag. This indicates to django that we want 
 to show the image located in the static media directory called images\rango.jpg. 
 Template tags are indicated by curly brackets with percentage signs. Calling static will combine the URL--
 specified in STATIC_URL with images\rango.jpg to provide the path of the 
 image we wish to display, being \static\images\rango.jpg 
 The HTML generated by the Django template engine would be:
<img src="/static/images/rango.jpg" alt="Picture of Rango" />-->
{% load staticfiles %} 
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Rango</title>
	</head>
	
	<body>
		<h1>Rango says...</h1>
		
		<div>
			hey there partner! <br />
			<strong>{{ boldmessage }}</strong><br />
		</div>
	
		<div>
			<a href="/rango/about/">About</a><br />
			<img src="{% static "images/rango.jpg" %}"
			     alt="Picture of Rango" /> <!-- This is the alternative text 
			which is displayed if for some reason the file doesnt load  -->
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
